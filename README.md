calen-derf
==========

`calen-derf` is a calendar program.  At least the start of one.  It
began life as a project for a functional programming class, but will
continue to grow to be useful as I have time for it.  So... it will
probably grow very slowly.

It has the beginnings of a nice library for dealing with ics and vcf
files.  Or at least a library, whether or not it's nice you can judge
yourself.  Some day I'll document it, after fleshing it out some more.

At the time of writing, the only useful thing it does is let you add
events to a vdir calendar, and get notifications on non-recurring events
(if you have the program `notify-send` installed, which probably only
exists for Unix OSes with an X11 display).
So there you have it.
